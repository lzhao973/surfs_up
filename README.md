## Summary:

It's a good idea to open ice-cream shop business in Oahu due to the consistent weather. The weather is relative hot in December compared to the rest of world. I also analysis the data for precipitation, it shows Oahu is seldom raining in June and December, it's dry and ice-cream could be popular there.
